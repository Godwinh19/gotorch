- Move tensors.go to a specific package directory (torch/tensor) where :
    - we perform tensors operations, not supported by gonum
    - make tensors compatible with neural networks
- Create autograd package under torch directory
- Make API for use of packages to construct networks
- Tensors broadcasting
- Training loss values follow a pattern after some epoch; investigate the reason
