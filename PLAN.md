- Move tensors.go to a specific package directory (torch/tensor) where :
    - we perform tensors operations, not supported by gonum
    - make tensors compatible with neural networks
- Create autograd package under torch directory
- Make API for use of packages to construct networks
- Tensors broadcasting
- Investigate on vanishing and exploding gradients techniques
- N-dimensional tensor operations
- Implement scaling, normalisation techniques (sklearn)
- Implement dataframe operations
- rollback to 1d type data tensor and figure out n-dimensional construction
